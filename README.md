# Sample Code Links for STC Ethiopia PSNP IE (RA Application)

Below are links to individual scripts that showcase my expertise in Stata, Python and R:
Note that these scripts are just part of the different workflows in the indicated research projects.

## Stata
[Data Cleaning for PSNP Impact Evaluation Analysis](https://github.com/gabegaz/code-sample/blob/main/Sample%201%20-%20psnp_data_cleaning_dealing_with_outliers.do)

This script is part of the data cleaning process of PSNP datasets. It performs cleaning of PSNP datasets - dealing with outliers of production/yield data of PSNP recepients/non-receipients.

[Analysis PSNP Impact Evaluation Analysis](https://github.com/gabegaz/code-sample/blob/main/Sample%202%20-%20reg_model_number_proj_on_irrigated_land.do)

This script performs regression analysis on the impact of cummulative number of irrigation projects (due to PSNP) on land area irrigated by combining agroecological and rainfall data from other sources.

[Conditional Logit on Crop Choice of Farmers in Recipient Woredas](https://github.com/gabegaz/code-sample/blob/main/Sample%203%20-%20conditional_logit_crop_choice_woreda%20.do)

This script performs regression analysis on the impact of PSNP on crop choice of cash recipient farmers.

[Looking at the labor market and/or unemployment over time and accross regions](https://github.com/gabegaz/code-sample/blob/main/Sample%204%20-%20Unemployment_NLFS_Graphs.do)

This script looks at the pattern of unemployment over time and accross regions etc. by using the national labor force surveys in 1999, 2005, 2013 and 2021

[gender analysis in the poultry sector(IFC-Ethiochicken dataset)](https://github.com/gabegaz/code-sample/blob/main/Sample%205%20-%20gender_analysis_poultry_ethiochicken.do)

The script checks if there are some systematic differences between male and female poultry agnets/owners in their productivity, access to services, sales revenue etc.

## Python
[openpyxl  and pandas-Python used to automate excel files](https://github.com/gabegaz/code-sample/blob/main/Sample%206%20-%20analysis_poultry.py)

This file shows how to use openpyxl and pandas (Python libraries) to extract data from more than 1500 excel files (filled questionnaires) and combine in one excel file (structured dataset) which will then be ready for analysis using Stata.

[openpyxl -Creating and formating tables in Ms Excel with Python](https://github.com/gabegaz/code-sample/blob/main/Sample%207%20-%20extracting_from_excel.py)

This script uses pandas/openpyxl to create and format tables on MS Excel. This helped me to work with my team for reproducibility of the work as doing the same using a manual workflow doesn't allow this.

## R
[Extraction of SPEI data and convert to csv](https://github.com/gabegaz/code-sample/blob/main/Sample%208%20-%20spei_dta_extraction.R)

This R code extracts data from The Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) in netcdf file format and converted it to csv file format for further geo spacial data analysis using Stata.
